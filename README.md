## The group hypothesis

Hypothesis and Goal:

The housing market is an integral part of millions of Americans lives. A home isn’t just where one’s heart is, it is also a where we spend most of our time, especially in the age of COVID. It should then be clear why, in part, determining a potential home’s worth is so important. Too high a price will crowd many out of the market, and a particularly low price could be an indicator of potential problem with the home itself. What is ultimately optimal is variant between individuals, but the main question for all potential buyers remains: “How much is this house really worth?”

For our project, we will answering just that. We will be performing a general analysis on the various factors that determine housing prices. More specifically, it is our belief that we can accurately predict a home’s price given a specific set of parameters. To begin, we complied a series of data sources from Zillow, climatology resource centers, and others. Using this data, we will be constructing a machine learning algorithm to accurately predict a home’s price given multiple parameters such as a potential abode’s number of bedrooms, square footage, and location to name a few examples. The type of machine learning we will be employing is a standard Multilinear Regression model, with housing price as our target or independent variables, and the earlier mentioned parameters like number of bedrooms as our dependent variables. 

Following initial regression on our existing data pool, it is then our goal to expand the scope of what factors accurately and precisely determine a home’s price by finding more data and adding more variables to our analysis.

As mentioned, our project will rely heavily on machine learning for the results regarding our analysis. Still, additional resources and technology will be used, most prominently python and various packages such as Matplotlib, Numpy, etc. We are also currently planning on employing tableau for data visualization and SQL, in particular, for joining portions of our data as needed.
